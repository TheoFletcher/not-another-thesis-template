## About the Project

Not Another Thesis Template provides a LaTeX class, perfect for a thesis, dissertation or report. The key design principles:

**Clean**  
A clean and simple look so your readers can focus on your writing, not the formatting.

**Minimal**  
Only includes the features and packages that are essential, leaving you free to add your own extensions.

**Flexible**  
Simple and extensive options for modifying the look of your document, so you can quickly get the style you want and meet your university formatting guidelines. Complete support for all the options in the standard `book` LaTeX class, as well as simple control over line spacing, title page, heading formatting and more.


## Examples
